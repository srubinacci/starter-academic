Reasearch in the field of computational and statistical genomics improved greatly in the last few years. The need to scale to large datasets motivated a great interest by researchers from all over the world. My research topic mainly focus on haplotype phasing and genotype imputation methods. 

Genotype imputation is the process of predicting unobserved genotypes in a sample of individuals using a reference panel of haplotypes. In the last 10 years reference panels have increased in size by more than 100 fold. Increasing reference panel size improves accuracy of markers with low minor allele frequencies but poses ever increasing computational challenges for imputation methods.
