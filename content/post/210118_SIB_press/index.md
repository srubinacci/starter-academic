## Overview

The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) released an article about our low-coverage whole genome sequencing imputation method 'GLIMPSE' and its applications. 
The target of the article is the general audience and it is available in [English](https://www.sib.swiss/about-sib/news/10818-inferring-human-genomes-at-a-fraction-of-the-current-cost-promises-to-boost-biomedical-research?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=glimpse), [French](https://www.sib.swiss/images/News/PressRelease_GLIMPSE_FR_2021-01-13.pdf) and [German](https://www.sib.swiss/images/News/PressRelease_GLIMPSE_DE_2021-01-13.pdf) and contains few quotes from me, Olivier and Diogo. 

Another article by [Heidi.news](https://www.heidi.news/sciences/des-chercheurs-suisses-inventent-une-methode-ultrarapide-d-analyse-genomique) nicely summarise our research (in French).

Additionally, Olivier had an interview at the Swiss national radio RTS discussing the paper, the method and its applications.
You can listen the interview [here](https://pages.rts.ch/la-1ere/programmes/cqfd/11863518-un-logiciel-pour-faire-analyser-notre-genome-a-moindre-cout-15-01-2021.html?mediaShare=1) (in French).

Feedbacks are always very appreciated!
