	abstract = {During COVID19 and other viral pandemics, rapid generation of host and pathogen genomic data is critical to tracking infection and informing therapies. There is an urgent need for efficient approaches to this data generation at scale. We have developed a scalable, high throughput approach to generate high fidelity low pass whole genome and HLA sequencing, viral genomes, and representation of human transcriptome from single nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID19 patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Protocolshttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1g5tRzVPf2wRIRnJLXy4vL1_vsQBBYlHrP52RdPlRvM4/edit?usp=sharinghttps://docs.google.com/document/d/13nSWleTHJeL4fZkUFdQk9hUHsDVIzhJw52y_Zj2MqFc/edit?usp=sharinghttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1yyre73aVnQgLyY1XCtb4LbC7X_2_VV-SELqnn4QG5zU/edit?usp=sharingFunding StatementTakeda Pharmaceuticals provided funding support for nucleic acid extraction and library preparation. One Lambda, Inc supplied HLA sequencing reagents and software. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Biohub supported all viral genome sequencing and alignment.
