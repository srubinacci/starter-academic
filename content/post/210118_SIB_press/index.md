## Overview

The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) released an article about our low-coverage whole genome sequencing imputation method 'GLIMPSE' and its applications. 
The target of the article is the general audience and it is available in [English](https://www.sib.swiss/about-sib/news/10818-inferring-human-genomes-at-a-fraction-of-the-current-cost-promises-to-boost-biomedical-research?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=glimpse), [French](https://www.sib.swiss/images/News/PressRelease_GLIMPSE_FR_2021-01-13.pdf) and [German](https://www.sib.swiss/images/News/PressRelease_GLIMPSE_DE_2021-01-13.pdf) and contains few quotes from me, Olivier and Diogo. 

Additionally, Olivier had an interview at the swiss national radio (RTS) discussing the paper, the method and its applications.
You can listen the interview [HERE](https://pages.rts.ch/la-1ere/programmes/cqfd/11863518-un-logiciel-pour-faire-analyser-notre-genome-a-moindre-cout-15-01-2021.html?mediaShare=1) (in French).
